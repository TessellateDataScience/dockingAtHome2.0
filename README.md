# Docking@Home
**Docking@Home** is a [volunteer computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteer_computing) project aiming to predict _protein-ligand interactions_ using [computer simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation), with the ultimate aim of expediting [medicine discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_discovery).

## Objective
With the emergence of [Folding@Home](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folding@home) research project having access to the world's most-powerful 'supercomputer', essentially for free, Docking@Home aims to mirror FAH's approach yet instead contribute towards developing vaccines via predicting [molecular docking]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_(molecular)) (instead of developing therapeutics via _protein folding_ that FAH concentrates on). 

Docking@Home aims to reduce the cost of drug development (estimated at ~ $USD 500 million per drug [1]) by using a [virtual screening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_screening) technique to reduce the number of vaccine-potential compounds that can be further investigated via more-costly biological (non-computational) experiments.

## Background
Docking@Home was a project that utilised the [BOINC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Open_Infrastructure_for_Network_Computing) software platform, and modelled protein-ligand interactions using the [CHARMM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHARMM) software program, until it's official retirement in 2014. The program allowed an extensive search of a finite number of protein-ligand structures, called [conformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_structure). Such conformations were predicted using ligand-based hierarchical clustering.
