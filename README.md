# Docking@Home
**Docking@Home** is a [volunteer computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteer_computing) project aiming to predict _protein-ligand interactions_ using [computer simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation), with the ultimate aim of expediting [medicine discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_discovery).

## Strategy
> Our mission is to democratise the drug discovery & development process. We aim to reduce the burden of goverment that overfunds R&D in this space relative to massively-rich pharmaceutical companies that then privatises this research and 'walls-out' the resultant vaccines, leading to greater inequity and more profits for them (unsurprisingly). More bluntly, we aim to fuck them, just like they fuck the people. 

They won't have as much power without 'consumers' buying their product. We also have another research project looking at [novel infection mitigation techniques harnessing fluid dynamics](https://github.com/TessellateDataScience/faceShieldOptimisations). If proof-of-concept can be demonstrated, we will turn attention to developing a more robust protection using Personal Protective Equipment (that hopefully rivals vaccine effectiveness).

## Objective
Docking@Home aims to reduce the cost of drug development (estimated at ~ $USD 500 million per drug [1]) by using a [virtual screening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_screening) technique to reduce the number of vaccine-potential compounds that can be further investigated via more-costly biological (non-computational) experiments.

With the emergence of [Folding@Home](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folding@home) research project having access to the world's most-powerful 'supercomputer', essentially for free, Docking@Home aims to mirror FAH's approach yet instead contribute towards developing vaccines via predicting [molecular docking]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_(molecular)) (instead of developing therapeutics via _protein folding_ that FAH concentrates on). 

## Background
Docking@Home was a project that utilised the [BOINC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Open_Infrastructure_for_Network_Computing) software platform, and modelled protein-ligand interactions using the [CHARMM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHARMM) software program, until it's official retirement in 2014. The program allowed an extensive search of a finite number of protein-ligand structures, called [conformations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_structure). Such conformations were predicted using ligand-based hierarchical clustering.
